            <h2> Welcome to the Doomfoolery website </h2>
            <span class="date">February 13, 2026</span>

            <p> After a month of the mod's first release, i was thinking about 
                how shall i post small sneak peaks, and progress without worrying
                about being annoying in the Doomworld forums, of course in the
                mod's thread, and with the fact that i wanted to make extra
                content for the mod to help to set its vibe, i think a website
                dedicated to it is a neat idea.

                I'm also quite new to making websites, so you may not see 
                nothing innovative in here, as this website only works to
                show updates on the mod as well as artwork, curiosities and
                future plans, feel free to roam around!.

                <br>
                <br>

                This website will also serve as a help for future secrets
                and hidden rooms in the mod!! awesomesauce isn't it???.
