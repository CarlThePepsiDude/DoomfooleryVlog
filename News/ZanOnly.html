            <h2> Moving completely to Zandronum </h2>
            <span class="date">February 13, 2026</span>

            <p> 
                
                So... i am new in modding too, while i was working 
                on the upcoming TDM update, i realized that trying to 
                stick to compatibility with many ports as possible was 
                going to be impossible (lol).

                <br>
                <br>

                Since Zandronum seems to be the main "hub" for Deathmatch Doom,
                and haves a lot of tools, resources and possibilityes
                surrounding the VS modes, i've came to the decision
                to move entirely to Zandronum.

                <br>
                <br>

                This meaning that the mod will lose compatibility with
                GZ and UZDoom.

                <br>
                <br>

                I came to the realization that when you do a mod that is not
                vanilla Doom, you're forced to choose a main port, and you
                may choose the port that benefits your mod the most, in my case,
                it was Zandronum.

                <br>
                <br>

                I've already done some work with the Zan lumps, and i think you
                guys will like the result.
